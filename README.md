This project contains the framework of the circular RNA toolbox ``circtools``.

# Installation

This package is written in python3. It has a number of external dependencies, mostly standard bioinformatics tools.

Installation is managed through `pip3`. The required privileges are determined by the installation location of `pip3`. In particular, if `pip3` does not require sudo access, then none of the installation process requires sudo access; this is the case if installed with the --user flag, for example.

Installation requires running pip:

```
git clone git@github.com:dieterich-lab/circtools.git
cd circtools
pip3 install --verbose --user
```
